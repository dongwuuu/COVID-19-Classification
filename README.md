# Lungs X-ray Chest Classification(COVID-19 or Other pneumonia)

    This project uses a convolutional neural network to build a classifier to determine whether a patient's pneumonia is due to neocoronavirus or other types of pneumonia. The data set is described below.

## Dataset

* [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
  
    The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal). Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.
